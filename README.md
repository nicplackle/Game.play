### Who made this beautiful page?
1. Wietse Gielen
2. Seppe Verhavert
3. Nic Placklé
4. Merel Van Puymbroeck
5. Blood, Sweat and Tears joined the team also!

### Why did we made this?

As our team said:

> "We made this to show our fancy skills and knowledge that we learned in this first month with HTML & CSS!<br>
> This is our final test Ok, you ready?! Let's go! 

### What is it? 

For our final test we needed to make a website for a fictional company. There where a lot of requirements we needed to look out for when we where working on this page.
<strong>Some examples:</strong><br>

- [ ] All buttons and links work
- [ ] All elements work and are complete (menu, lists, images, ...)
- [ ] Everything on the page has a function, a reason to be there
- [ ] No dead links
- [ ] English and dutch are not mixed
- [ ] No spelling errors
- [ ] No grammar errors
- [ ] The website is deployed somewhere
- [ ] Everything is relevant (no image of a barber on the website of a baker)
- [x] A bunch of requirements

In the end we merged our 4 pages in one smooth page. 

### Okay cool, but what is it doing here on GitHub? 

Because it is a fictional project, we shared it on GitHub instead putting it online. It's a big project for us to let you guys see where we already stand after one month of coding and learning. 

### Proud on this!

#### Why we are proud on this element above?

Well cause the navigation looks really awesome with the cool and relatable icons in it!(Yes it does work too)
Also our lay-out, as you can see, isn't a mess. We really thought a lot about the lay-out and the design of it and spend a lot of time on it and changed our minds like 3 times.

### What did we use?
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap
5. A bit of our brain :trollface:

### Extra stuff we are proud on!

- Parallax
- Slider
- Forum
- Nice Footer
- Sticky navigations and header
- Video's
- Clipart
- Video previews
- Git (experts)
- Atm 203 of 218 commits!Yeah boii

## Some interesting code

```
---------- CSS ----------
    video {
        display: none;
        position: relative;
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

    .card:hover video {
        display: block;
    }

    .card:hover img.card-img-top{
        display: none;
    }

---------- HTML ----------
                    <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6 mb-4">
                    <div class="card h-100 bg-dark" >
        
                        <a onclick="load('Rust')">
                            <img class="card-img-top" src="https://www.kitguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maxresdefault-1.jpg" alt="">
                            <div class="thumb" onclick="clicksound.playclip()" onMouseover="mouseoversound.playclip()">
                                <video muted id="video1" onmouseover="this.play()" onmouseout="this.pause()" loop>
                                    <source src="assets/videos/rust.mp4" type="video/mp4" >
                                    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
                                </video>
                            </div>
                            <img class="play" src="https://www.legacycitychurch.com/media/cover_art/Play%20Button%20Overlay/imageedit_1_8651219148.png">
                        </a>
        
                        <div class="card-body">
                        <h4 class="card-title">
                            <a onclick="load('Rust')" class="text-white">Rust</a>
                        </h4>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
```
### So why that code? 

This is a little code about the part where we can hover on the image and a little video about the game starts. So we only used html and css to create this. in the html we made a link with a "onclick". Next we got a div wit the image and after the video. In the CSS we just change the display and position to get that effect. Nice and simple isn't it?

##### Thank you come again, have a nice day! :shipit:
